## 🎯 What This Project Does

**In One Sentence:**  
Build a tool that takes a CSV of domain names, calls SpyFu APIs, and outputs an enhanced CSV with SEO intelligence for cold calling.

**NOT:** A real-time system that runs during phone calls  
**YES:** A batch processor that enriches lead lists BEFORE calls

**Option 2 (Detailed):**
> "I'm starting the SpyFu project from PROJECT_HANDOFF.md. I want to build a CSV enhancement tool that:
> 1. Takes domain list as input
> 2. Calls SpyFu APIs for SEO data
> 3. Outputs enhanced CSV
> 
> I need help deciding which 15 fields to include above-the-fold and then building the tool."

**Option 3 (Just Build It):**
> "Read PROJECT_HANDOFF.md and build me a CSV enhancement tool with reasonable defaults. Use APIs #1, #2, #3 (skip competitors for now). Choose the 15 most important fields yourself."

## 🎯 Success Criteria

**You'll know you're ready when:**
- ✅ You understand it's a batch CSV processor (not real-time)
- ✅ You know there are 4 APIs available
- ✅ You know 26 fields are available (need to pick 15)
- ✅ You have the API credentials
- ✅ You know test data already exists

**Then just ask me to:**
- Help choose the 15 fields
- Build the enhancement script
- Test it on existing data
- Run it on a new domain list

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ Don't think this is a real-time call center popup  
✅ It's a batch CSV enrichment tool

❌ Don't try to call APIs during phone calls  
✅ Process the CSV once, BEFORE any calls happen

❌ Don't recreate test data  
✅ Use existing master_test_results.json

❌ Don't skip rate limiting  
✅ Add 1-second delay between domain API calls

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use test data first** - Don't waste API calls during development
2. **Start with 3 APIs** - Skip competitors initially to save cost
3. **Let me suggest fields** - I can recommend the best 15 based on use case
4. **Test on 5 domains** - Don't run full list until working perfectly

---

## 📞 Questions?

Just ask me:
- "What are the 4 APIs?"
- "Which 15 fields should I choose?"
- "Show me the test data structure"
- "Build the tool with reasonable defaults"
- "Explain the local keyword detection"
