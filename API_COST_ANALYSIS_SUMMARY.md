## Key Insights

### 1. Cost vs. Value Trade-Off
- **High-cost domains provide MORE cold calling ammunition**
  - salemplasticsurgery.com: $0.14 cost → 233 Page 1 keywords + 45 fell-off opportunities
  - alignwc.com: $0.31 cost → 535 Page 1 keywords + 89 fell-off opportunities
- These "over-budget" domains actually deliver 10-20x more talking points for sales calls

### 2. Cost Drivers
- **Keyword Count**: More Page 1 rankings = higher Keywords API cost
- **Recent Activity**: More fell-off keywords = higher Fell-Off API cost
- **Formula**: Cost increases with SEO success (more to talk about in cold calls)

### 3. Zero-Cost Domains
- 2 domains (healthwestchiro.com, 100percentdoc.com) have no SEO presence
- $0 API cost but also $0 cold calling value
- May need different sales approach (no SEO pain points to leverage)

### 4. Sweet Spot Domains
- painreliefkc.com: $0.01 cost, 15 Page 1 keywords, 4 fell-off keywords
- axiominjury.com: $0.002 cost, 2 Page 1 keywords, 1 fell-off keyword
- Low cost, sufficient data for effective cold calling
