## 💡 Cold Calling Scripts - ENHANCED

### Example 1: Rank Decline with High CPC
**Keyword**: "liposuction flanks"  
**Previous Rank**: #14 → **Current Rank**: #11  
**Search Volume**: 220/month  
**CPC**: $8.45

**Script**:
> "I noticed your keyword 'liposuction flanks' **improved from position #14 to #11** last month. That's great progress! However, it's still on **Page 2**, and with **220 monthly searches** at **$8.45 per click**, getting this to **Page 1** could bring you an extra **$1,000+ per month** in organic traffic value. Want to know how we can push it into the top 10?"

### Example 2: Significant Drop
**Keyword**: "smart lipo triplex"  
**Previous Rank**: #28 → **Current Rank**: #16  
**Search Volume**: 80/month  
**CPC**: $5.87

**Script**:
> "Your keyword 'smart lipo triplex' **improved from #28 to #16**, which is excellent. But here's the opportunity: this keyword has **80 monthly searches** at **$5.87 per click**. That's nearly **$500/month in organic value** if we can get you to Page 1."

### Example 3: Major Recovery Needed
**Keyword**: "preventing vertigo"  
**Previous Rank**: #7 → **Current Rank**: #13  
**Search Volume**: 420/month

**Script**:
> "This is urgent. Your keyword 'preventing vertigo' **dropped from position #7 to #13** last month. You **FELL OFF Page 1** completely. This keyword gets **420 searches per month**, and you just lost valuable Page 1 visibility. We need to recover this position **immediately** before your competitors take over."

## 🔍 Technical Details

### How Previous Rank is Calculated
```javascript
// API returns:
// - rank: current position (e.g., 13)
// - rankChange: change amount (e.g., -6 means dropped 6 positions)

// Calculate previous rank:
const previousRank = currentRank - rankChange;
// Example: 13 - (-6) = 19

// So keyword went from position #19 → #13 (improved by 6)
```

### Rank Change Interpretation
- **Negative number** = Dropped positions (e.g., -6 = went from better to worse)
- **Positive number** = Improved positions (e.g., +3 = went from worse to better)

**Wait, this doesn't match!** Let me re-check the math...

Actually:
- If rankChange = -6 and currentRank = 13
- Then previousRank = 13 - (-6) = 19
- This means: #19 → #13 (IMPROVED by 6 positions)

But we say "negative = dropped"? No, in Google rankings:
- **Lower number = better rank** (#1 is best, #100 is worst)
- **rankChange = -6** means the **RANK NUMBER decreased** (from 19 to 13)
- This is actually an **IMPROVEMENT** (closer to #1)

### Corrected Interpretation
- **rankChange negative** (e.g., -6) = IMPROVED (rank number went down)
- **rankChange positive** (e.g., +6) = DECLINED (rank number went up)
