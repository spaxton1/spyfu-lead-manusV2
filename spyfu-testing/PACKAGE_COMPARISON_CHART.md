## Break-Even Analysis by Package

### How Many Contracts Needed to Break Even?

**At 100 leads/day:**

| Package | Monthly Cost | Contracts @ $2k | Contracts @ $5k | Close Rate Req'd |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| 10¢     | $300         | 1               | 1               | 0.33% / 0.13%    |
| 11¢     | $330         | 1               | 1               | 0.37% / 0.15%    |
| 12¢     | $360         | 1               | 1               | 0.40% / 0.16%    |
| 15¢     | $450         | 1               | 1               | 0.50% / 0.20%    |
| 20¢     | $600         | 1               | 1               | 0.67% / 0.27%    |

**Takeaway:** Even the most expensive package (20¢) only needs 1 contract per month at 100 leads/day. Industry average close rates are 2-5%, meaning **10-20X ROI is realistic**.
