## ðŸŽ¯ RECOMMENDED STARTING MODELS

### **Best Universal Choice: A2 (12Â¢ COMPETITOR ASSAULT)**
**Why:** Names specific competitors + shows direct battles + creates urgency
```
"Hi John, tesla.com is beating you on 187 keywords - that's an 89% loss rate.  
They're getting $69,435/mo in traffic you're missing. But I found 24 keywords  
where you're ahead of them at #11-13. Push those to page 1 = $1,847/mo..."
```

### **Best for Creating Urgency: B1 (12Â¢ MOMENTUM TRACKER)**
**Why:** Shows velocity + trajectory + "you're losing ground" narrative
```
"Your rankings are declining at NET -3 positions per month while your competitor  
is gaining +55. The gap is widening by 966 positions monthly. But you have 147  
'Almost There' keywords at #11-16 worth $2,847/mo if we push them to page 1..."
```

## ðŸ’° ROI CALCULATOR

### Cost Per Day Examples:
- **100 leads/day Ã— $0.12 = $12/day** ($360/month)
- **500 leads/day Ã— $0.12 = $60/day** ($1,800/month)
- **1,000 leads/day Ã— $0.12 = $120/day** ($3,600/month)

### Revenue at Different Close Rates:
**Scenario: 500 leads/day Ã— $0.12 = $1,800/month cost**

| Close Rate | Contracts/Month | @ $2,000 Contract | @ $5,000 Contract | Net Profit |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|
| 0.1% | 15 | $30,000 | $75,000 | **$28,200 - $73,200** |
| 0.2% | 30 | $60,000 | $150,000 | **$58,200 - $148,200** |
| 0.5% | 75 | $150,000 | $375,000 | **$148,200 - $373,200** |

**At just 0.1% close rate (1 in 1,000), you net $28K-73K per month!**

## ðŸ”¥ TOP 5 DATA NUGGETS (Across All Models)

### 1. "Almost There" Keywords (#11-16)
**Every model includes this goldmine**
- Easy to calculate exact ROI
- Low effort, high reward
- Segment into Tier 1 (#11-13) vs Tier 2 (#14-16)

**Example from real data:**
> "You have 147 keywords ranked #11-16. Push just the 52 in Tier 1 (#11-13)  
> to page 1 and that's $1,847 per month in traffic value. I estimate 80 hours  
> of work. That's $23 per hour return on labor."

### 2. Head-to-Head Record (Competitor Models)
**Models: A2, A3, A4, B3**
- Win/Loss record creates urgency
- Shows percentage loss rate

**Example from real data:**
> "When I look at keywords you both rank for - the record is 187-23-12.  
> That's they win 187, you win 23, and 12 are tied. You have an 89%  
> loss rate in direct competition."

### 3. Sum of Rank Change (Velocity Models)
**Models: B1, B2, B3**
- Not just "how many improved" but "how MUCH they improved"
- Shows magnitude of movement

**Example from real data:**
> "In the last 30 days, you gained 94 positions but lost 97. Net: -3 positions.  
> Your competitor gained 1,247 and lost only 284. Net: +963 positions.  
> The gap widened by 966 positions in just one month."

### 4. Money Keyword Potential
**Every model calculates this**
- Shows what traffic would be worth at #1
- Uses real CPC data

**Example from real data:**
> "'photovoltaic cell' - you're #51 getting 28 clicks/month. At #1, you'd  
> get 2,025 clicks. That's $2.49 CPC Ã— 2,025 = $5,042 per month in traffic  
> value from ONE keyword."

### 5. Competitor Keyword Gap
**Models: A2, A3, A4, B3**
- Shows how many keywords they rank for that you don't
- Expansion opportunity

**Example from real data:**
> "tesla.com ranks for 74,300 keywords you DON'T have. When I filter for  
> high-value (CPC > $5, volume > 200), that's 8,472 keywords worth  
> $312,400 per month in traffic value. That's your expansion opportunity."

### A2 Script (Competitor Assault)
> "Your top competitor, [competitor.com], has [X] rankings compared to your [Y].

### B1 Script (Momentum Tracker)
> "I analyzed your ranking velocity over the last 30 days. You gained [X] positions

> But [Competitor 2] just dropped [M] keywords - that's a vulnerability.  
>  
> I found [uncontested number] keywords where you rank but NO top-5 competitor does.  
> That's $[value]/mo in uncontested territory if we push them to page 1..."
