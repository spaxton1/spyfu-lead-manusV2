## üé£ The "Fishing" Framework (Applied to All Packages)

### 1. CAST THE BAIT (5-10 sec)
**Permission-based opening**
> "Do you have 45 seconds? Found something you need to see..."

### 2. WIGGLE (30-40 sec)
**Hit hot buttons with real data**
> "94.7% of your rankings are buried on page 2... You lost 92 rankings in 90 days..."

### 3. THE BITE (20-30 sec)
**Specific examples with dollar values**
> "'Pool design' #12, $8.51 CPC, 2 spots from page 1 = $2,127/mo..."

### 4. SET THE HOOK (20-30 sec)
**Show you can deliver (reference their strengths)**
> "You've got 'pool builder' at #1, so you KNOW how to rank..."

### 5. REEL TO SHORE (30-45 sec)
**Action plan with timeline and ROI**
> "Fix 8 fallen + push 10 almost-there = $5,000/mo in 60-90 days. Want to see the plan?"

## üéØ Key Differentiators (Why This Wins)

- Average CPC: **$4.84** vs $1.09 (4.4X better)
- Buyer intent: Higher quality despite lower percentage
- Extra cost: **$0.09** but worth it for true money keywords

### 2. ‚úÖ Traffic Distribution Math
**Your 20 Years of Data:**
- Position #1: 40% of traffic
- Position #2: 20%
- Position #3: 10%
- Positions #4-10: Single digits
- **Applied to every calculation**

### 3. ‚úÖ "Missed Opportunities" Focus
Every package leads with what they're leaving on the table:
- "147 keywords at #11-20 worth $2,847/mo"

### 4. ‚úÖ Real Data, No Estimates

- Real CPC values ($8.51, $5.94, $6.31)
- Real search volume (8,100, 1,600, 720)
- Real competitor positions

### 5. ‚úÖ Fishing Approach Applied
Every script follows your proven framework:

## üí° Pro Tips

### Tip #1: Start Small, Scale Fast
Don't go 0 ‚Üí 500 leads/day. Go 10 ‚Üí 50 ‚Üí 100 ‚Üí 500.

### Tip #2: Record Everything
First 100 calls should all be recorded and reviewed.

### Tip #3: Trust the Data
Agents should read numbers verbatim. "$2,847" not "about $3,000"

### Tip #4: Match Package to Prospect
Competitive personality? Use Competitor Assault. Budget-conscious? Use Opportunity Hunter.

### Tip #5: Always Name Competitors
When you have competitor data, USE IT. Creates instant urgency.

### Tip #6: Show Them Winning
Always reference at least ONE thing they're doing right before hitting problems.

### Tip #7: Traffic Distribution = Gold
The 40% / 20% / 10% math sells itself. Use it every call.

### Tip #8: Specific Timeline Required
Never say "we can help." Say "60-90 days, 80 hours of work, $5,000/mo value."
