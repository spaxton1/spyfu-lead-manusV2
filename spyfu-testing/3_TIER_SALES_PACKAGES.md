### 🎣 COLD CALL SCRIPT (Opportunity Hunter)

**[CAST THE BAIT]**
> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I was doing some SEO research in the [pool construction] industry and pulled up your website. Found something you need to see - do you have 45 seconds?"

**[WIGGLE #1 - Page 1 Gap]**
> "Your site has 1,451 keyword rankings in Google, which is solid, but here's the problem - **94.7% are buried on page 2 or higher**. You only have 77 keywords on page 1. That means 1,374 keywords are generating virtually zero traffic. That's $3,100 per month in lost business sitting there."

**[WIGGLE #2 - Almost There Money]**
> "But here's what got my attention - you have 147 keywords sitting at positions 11-20, just barely off page 1. These aren't junk keywords either. I found 'pool design' at #12 with an $8.51 cost-per-click, 'custom pools near me' at #15 worth $5.94, and 'pool construction process' at #14 worth $6.31. Combined, if we push just those 3 to page 1, that's $5,129 per month in traffic value."

**[THE BITE - Low Hanging Fruit]**
> "And it gets better - you already have 23 keywords ranking in positions 2-10 on page 1. For example, 'swimming pool contractors' is at #3. Position 3 gets about 10% of the clicks, but position 1 gets 40%. That's a 4X increase just by moving 2 spots. On that one keyword alone, we're talking $1,892 more per month."

**[SET THE HOOK - Recent Loss]**
> "One more thing that concerned me - in the last 30 days, 8 of your money keywords fell off page 1. Your 'pool installation cost' keyword dropped from #8 to #13. That's an $8.45 cost-per-click keyword, and you just lost $1,014 per month on that drop alone."

**[REEL TO SHORE]**
> "Listen, I've done this for [X years]. When I see 147 keywords sitting at positions 11-20 with high dollar values, and another 23 already on page 1 that just need a small push, that's about 60-80 hours of solid SEO work to unlock $4,200 per month in additional traffic. Would you want me to show you exactly which keywords we'd target first and why they're the easiest wins?"

### 🎣 COLD CALL SCRIPT (History Tracker)

**[CAST THE BAIT - Hit 'em with loss]**
> "Hi [Name], [Your Name] here. I was analyzing SEO data in the [pool] industry and pulled up your site. I found something concerning - do you have a minute?"

**[WIGGLE #1 - History Loss]**
> "Over the last 90 days, your website lost 92 keyword rankings in Google. You went from 1,543 rankings down to 1,451. That's a 6% drop in visibility. But here's what's worse - those 92 keywords were worth $1,247 per month in traffic value. That's $14,964 per year in lost business."

**[WIGGLE #2 - Page 1 Decline]**
> "And it's not just total rankings - your page 1 presence is declining. You had 89 keywords on page 1 three months ago. Today you have 77. That's a 13.5% drop. Meanwhile, your competitors are taking those spots."

**[THE BITE - Recent Bleeding]**
> "In just the last 30 days, 10 of your keywords declined an average of 7 positions each. Your 'pool installation cost' keyword? It was #8 on page 1. Now it's #13 on page 2. That's an $8.45 cost-per-click keyword, and you just lost $1,014 per month on that single drop. 'Pool repair services' fell from #9 to #16 - that's a $6.20 keyword, also bleeding."

**[SET THE HOOK - Trajectory]**
> "Listen, I run these analyses for pool companies all the time. At your current decline rate, in the next 90 days, you'll lose another 138 rankings worth $1,800 per month. That's compounding losses. But here's the good news - you still have 147 keywords sitting at positions 11-20, worth $2,847 per month if we push them to page 1. And you've got 'pool builder' at #1, which means you DO know how to rank."

**[REEL TO SHORE]**
> "The question is: do we stop the bleeding first, or do you let it continue? I can show you exactly which keywords are declining fastest, why they're dropping, and the specific technical issues causing it. Plus, I'll show you the 10 'almost there' keywords that would give you $5,000 per month back. Want to see what's actually happening before you lose more ground?"

### 🎣 COLD CALL SCRIPT (Balanced Combo)

**[CAST THE BAIT]**
> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. Quick question - do you actively manage your Google rankings for your pool business, or is it more set-it-and-forget-it?"

**[WIGGLE #1 - Mixed Signals]**
> "I ask because I just pulled your SEO data and found something interesting. You have 1,451 keyword rankings, which is solid, and I can see you've got 20 keywords improving in the last 30 days - so your SEO IS working. But at the same time, you lost 92 rankings over the last 90 days, including 8 money keywords that fell off page 1."

**[WIGGLE #2 - The Page 1 Gap]**
> "Here's what concerns me most: 94.7% of your rankings are buried on page 2 or higher. Only 77 out of 1,451 are on page 1. That means 1,374 keywords are generating virtually zero traffic. And the kicker? You have 147 keywords sitting at positions 11-20 - just barely off page 1 - worth $2,847 per month if we push them up."

**[THE BITE - Real Examples]**
> "Let me give you two specific examples. 'Pool design' is ranked #12 with an $8.51 cost-per-click - that's 2 spots from page 1, worth $2,127 per month. 'Custom pools near me' is at #15, worth $5.94 per click, about $1,425 per month. Those are high-value buyer intent keywords that are RIGHT THERE, just need a small push."

**[BUILD TENSION - The Loss]**
> "Now here's the frustrating part. Last month, your 'pool installation cost' keyword dropped from #8 to #13. That's an $8.45 cost-per-click keyword, and you just lost $1,014 per month in traffic on that one drop alone. You went from page 1 to page 2, which means you went from getting clicks to getting almost nothing."

**[SET THE HOOK - Show the Win]**
> "But I also saw you moved 'pool maintenance tips' from #48 to #42 - a 6-position jump. That tells me your SEO CAN work when it's done right. And you've got 'pool builder' at position #1 with a $7.20 cost-per-click. So you know HOW to rank for competitive terms."

**[REEL TO SHORE]**
> "Look, you've got momentum in some areas and bleeding in others. What I'd like to do is show you exactly which 10 'almost there' keywords would give you the fastest $5,000 per month return, and which 8 fallen keywords need immediate defense. This is about 60-80 hours of work over 90 days. Can I walk you through the specific keyword strategy so you can see exactly what we'd fix first?"

### 🎣 COLD CALL SCRIPT (Competitor Assault)

**[CAST THE BAIT - Name the enemy]**
> "Hi [Name], [Your Name] here. Quick question - are you familiar with riverpoolsandspas.com?"

**[WIGGLE #1 - Size Comparison]**
> "I ask because I was doing competitive SEO research in the pool industry, and I pulled up your site alongside theirs. They have 4,892 keyword rankings in Google with a monthly traffic value of $18,240. You have 1,451 rankings worth $3,264. They're 3.4 times bigger than you in search visibility."

**[WIGGLE #2 - Direct Combat]**
> "But here's what really got my attention. I found 147 keywords where both you and River Pools rank. Out of those 147 direct battles, they're beating you on 112, you're beating them on 21, and 14 are tied. That's a 76% loss rate in head-to-head keyword combat."

**[THE BITE - Specific Example]**
> "Let me show you a specific example. 'Pool design' - $8.51 cost-per-click keyword. They rank #3, which gets about 10% of the traffic. You rank #12 on page 2, which gets essentially 0%. On that single keyword, they're getting traffic and leads while you're invisible. And 'fiberglass pools' - a $9.20 keyword - they're #1, you're #47. You're not even in the game on that one."

**[BUILD TENSION - Portfolio Gap]**
> "They also rank for 3,441 keywords that you don't rank for at all. I filtered just the top 10 highest-value ones - those alone are worth $8,400 per month. They've built a keyword portfolio that's dominating your market."

**[SET THE HOOK - Show Weakness]**
> "But here's the interesting part - they're not invincible. In the last 30 days, they dropped 8 keywords. Their 'pool financing' keyword fell from #5 to #11 - that's a vulnerable spot. And I found 23 keywords where you're ranked #11-20, but River Pools doesn't even rank. Those are open lanes where you can win without fighting them."

**[REEL TO SHORE]**
> "You've also got 'pool builder' at #1 where they rank #28, so you CAN beat them when you execute right. Look, I've mapped out a battle plan: take the 23 unguarded keywords first, steal the 8 weak spots where they're dropping, then attack the shared keywords where the gap is smallest. That's $4,200 per month in 60-90 days, and you close the gap on River Pools. Want to see the specific keyword battlefield map?"

### 🎣 COLD CALL SCRIPT (Complete Intelligence)

**[CAST THE BAIT - Market position]**
> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I specialize in competitive SEO analysis for pool companies. I just finished mapping the competitive landscape in [your area/industry], and your name came up. You're ranked #7 out of 10 major players. Do you know who's #1?"

**[WIGGLE #1 - Name the King]**
> "It's riverpoolsandspas.com. They have 4,892 keyword rankings generating $18,240 per month in traffic value. You have 1,451 rankings worth $3,264. They're 3.4 times bigger. But here's what's more concerning - in the last 90 days, you lost 92 rankings while River Pools gained 60. The gap is widening."

**[WIGGLE #2 - Your Internal Problem]**
> "Looking at just your site, 94.7% of your 1,451 rankings are buried on page 2 or higher. You only have 77 keywords on page 1. River Pools has 423 on page 1 - that's 5.5 times more page 1 visibility. But here's the opportunity buried in that data..."

**[THE BITE - Almost There]**
> "You have 147 keywords ranked at positions #11-20, just barely off page 1, worth $2,847 per month if we push them up. I found 'pool design' at #12 - $8.51 cost-per-click - River Pools is at #3, you're 9 spots behind. 'Custom pools near me' at #15, $5.94 per click - River Pools isn't even ranking for that one. That's an open lane."

**[BUILD TENSION - Recent Losses]**
> "In the last 30 days, 8 of your money keywords fell off page 1. 'Pool installation cost' - $8.45 keyword - dropped from #8 to #13. That's $1,014 per month in lost traffic right there. Meanwhile, you've got 23 keywords already on page 1 in positions #2-10. If we push those to #1, that's $1,892 per month based on the traffic distribution math - position 1 gets 40%, position 2 gets 20%."

**[SET THE HOOK - Competitor Weakness]**
> "Now here's where it gets interesting. River Pools isn't perfect. They dropped 8 keywords last month - 'pool financing' fell from #5 to #11. That's vulnerable. And you have 23 keywords at #11-20 where they don't even rank. You've also got 12 #1 rankings, including 'pool builder' at $7.20 CPC where they rank #28. So you CAN beat them when you execute."

**[REEL TO SHORE]**
> "I've mapped out a 3-phase plan: Phase 1, defend your 8 fallen keywords to stop the bleeding - that's $847 per month recovered. Phase 2, push 10 'almost there' keywords to page 1 - that's $2,847 per month gained. Phase 3, attack the 8 spots where River Pools is weak - that's another $2,500 per month. Total value: $6,194 per month, 60-90 day timeline. Want to see the actual keyword list and battle plan?"

### 🎣 COLD CALL SCRIPT (Market Domination)

**[CAST THE BAIT - Industry analysis angle]**
> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. I just finished a comprehensive SEO market analysis of the pool industry in [your market], covering the top 10 players. Your company came up as #7. I found some things you need to see - do you have 2 minutes?"

**[WIGGLE #1 - Market Position Reality]**
> "Out of the top 10 pool companies in your market, you're ranked #7 with 1,451 keyword rankings. The top 3 are riverpoolsandspas.com with 4,892 rankings, poolpros.com with 3,244, and premieraquascape.com with 2,891. Your market share is about 2.1%. But here's what's concerning - six months ago, you were at 2.4%. You're losing ground at 0.1% per quarter."

**[WIGGLE #2 - The 3-Way Battle]**
> "I analyzed every keyword where you compete directly with these top 3. Against River Pools, you lose 76% of the battles. Against Pool Pros, you lose 68%. Against Premier, 71%. On average, when you go head-to-head, you're losing 7 out of 10 fights. And the trend is getting worse."

**[WIGGLE #3 - Page 1 Warfare]**
> "Let's talk page 1 presence. You have 77 keywords on page 1. River Pools has 423. Pool Pros has 298. Premier has 247. They have between 3 and 5 times more page 1 visibility than you. And over the last 6 months, while they grew their page 1 count by 6-7%, yours declined by 13.5%. You're moving in opposite directions."

**[THE BITE - But Here's the Gap]**
> "Now, I did find opportunities in all this data. You have 147 keywords ranked at positions #11-20, worth $2,847 per month if pushed to page 1. But here's what's interesting - I filtered those 147 into two groups: 58 where all 3 competitors are already on page 1 - those are hard fights. But 89 where only 0 or 1 competitor ranks on page 1 - those are easy wins. 

> Even better, I found 47 keywords where you rank #11-20 and NONE of the top 3 rank at all. That's $4,200 per month in completely unguarded territory. For example, 'custom pools near me' - you're #15, $5.94 cost-per-click, none of them rank. 'Pool construction process' - you're #14, $6.31, only Premier ranks at #23. These are open lanes."

**[BUILD TENSION - Recent Losses]**
> "In the last 30 days, you lost 8 keywords from page 1, including 'pool installation' which dropped from #8 to #13. At the same time, Premier moved that keyword from #11 to #9. They literally took your spot. That one keyword alone cost you $1,014 per month."

**[BUILD MORE TENSION - Velocity Comparison]**
> "Here's the trajectory math. River Pools is growing at 2.1% per month. Pool Pros at 1.8%. Premier at 1.2%. You're declining at 0.7% per month. At this rate, in the next 90 days, you'll lose another 30 rankings worth $420 per month, while they collectively gain 100 rankings worth $1,800 per month. The gap is widening by $2,220 per month every quarter."

**[SET THE HOOK - But You Have Strengths]**
> "Now, you're not helpless here. You have 12 keywords ranked #1, including 'pool builder' at $7.20 cost-per-click where none of the top 3 beat you. That proves you CAN compete when you execute. And I found weaknesses in all three competitors - River Pools dropped 8 keywords, Pool Pros dropped 12, Premier dropped 6. They're not invincible."

**[REEL TO SHORE - The Roadmap]**
> "Look, I've built you a 3-year market domination roadmap. Year 1: Take the 47 unguarded keywords - that's $4,200 per month with minimal competition. Year 2: Attack the 26 vulnerable spots where they're weak - that's $5,100 per month. Year 3: Go to war on the shared battlefields where the gap is closeable - that's $9,800 per month. 

> But the first step is stopping the bleeding and defending the 8 that fell off page 1 - that's $847 per month recovered. Then pushing 10 of your 'almost there' keywords to page 1 - that's $2,847 per month gained. Combined, that's $3,694 per month in the first 60-90 days.

> I've got a 47-page competitive battlefield analysis ready to go with every keyword, every competitor position, every gap, and the exact technical reasons they're beating you. Want to see it?"

### 🎣 COLD CALL SCRIPT (Velocity Domination)

**[CAST THE BAIT - Trend analysis angle]**
> "Hi [Name], [Your Name] here from [Company]. I run predictive SEO analytics for pool companies, and your site came up in my trend analysis with some concerning patterns. Do you have a minute to hear what I found?"

**[WIGGLE #1 - The Decline Trajectory]**
> "Six months ago, your website had 1,543 keyword rankings in Google. Three months ago, 1,497. Today, 1,451. You've lost 92 rankings - that's a 6% decline. At your current velocity of negative 0.7% per month, you'll lose another 30 rankings in the next 90 days, 60 in the next 180 days, and 120 over the next year. That's an 8.3% total decline."

**[WIGGLE #2 - Page 1 Erosion]**
> "But what's more concerning is page 1. Six months ago, you had 89 keywords on page 1. Three months ago, 83. Today, 77. That's a 13.5% decline in page 1 presence - which is where all the traffic comes from. And it's accelerating. Three months ago, you were losing about 2 page 1 keywords per month. Last month you lost a net of 2 in just 30 days."

**[WIGGLE #3 - Traffic Impact]**
> "The traffic numbers prove it. Six months ago, you were getting 562 clicks per month from organic search. Three months ago, 531. Today, 498. You've bled 64 clicks per month - an 11.4% decline. That's real traffic, real leads, real business walking away."

**[THE BITE - Momentum Analysis]**
> "Now, I did dig into the movement data to see what's causing this. Last 30 days, you had 30 keywords improving and 20 declining. That sounds good until you look at the math. Those 30 improving keywords gained a total of 154 positions. The 20 declining ones lost 157 positions. Net movement: negative 3. You're losing slightly more ground than you're gaining."

**[BUILD TENSION - Specific Examples]**
> "'Pool maintenance tips' moved from #48 to #42, up 6 spots - that's good, your SEO IS working somewhere. But 'pool installation cost' dropped from #8 to #13, down 5 spots. That's an $8.45 cost-per-click keyword, and you just lost $1,014 per month on that single drop. The losses are outweighing the wins."

**[BUILD MORE TENSION - Page 1 Net]**
> "Here's the page 1 math. Last 30 days, 6 keywords made it to page 1 - gained $624 per month. But 8 keywords fell off page 1 - lost $847 per month. Net: negative 2 keywords on page 1, negative $223 per month. And the trend is getting worse. Three months ago, 11 were making page 1. Last month, only 6. Your conversion rate from 'almost there' to page 1 is slowing down."

**[SET THE HOOK - Competitor Comparison]**
> "Meanwhile, your top competitor, River Pools, gained a net 35 positions last month while you lost 3. That's a 38-position gap widening every single month. At this rate, the gap will be 456 positions wider in 12 months."

**[SHOW THE OPPORTUNITY]**
> "But here's what's interesting in your data. You have 147 keywords at positions #11-20, worth $2,847 per month. That number is actually UP from 136 three months ago - an 8.1% increase. So you're building a backlog of 'almost there' keywords, but they're not converting to page 1 fast enough. That's a conversion problem, not a ranking problem. Your SEO is partially working - it's getting keywords close - but something's failing at the finish line."

**[REEL TO SHORE]**
> "Here's what needs to happen. First, stop the bleeding on the 8 that fell off page 1 - that's $847 per month recovered. Second, figure out why your 'almost there' conversion rate is 4.1% when industry average is 8%, and fix it. Third, push 10 of those 147 to page 1 - that's $2,847 per month gained. If we reverse your trajectory from negative 0.7% per month to positive 1.5% per month, that's a $3,200 per month swing in 90 days. I've got a velocity intervention plan that focuses on the specific technical reasons your momentum is stalling. Want to see it?"

# 🎯 NEXT STEPS

1. **Choose your starting package** - Recommend 12¢ Opportunity + History for universal appeal
2. **Test with 20-30 prospects** - Track which data points get the strongest reactions
