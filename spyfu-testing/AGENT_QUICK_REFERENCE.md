## 🎣 6-STEP COLD CALL FRAMEWORK

### 1. CAST THE BAIT (5-10 sec)
**Permission-based opening**
```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] from [Company]. 
I was pulling SEO data for [industry] companies and your site came up. 
Found something you need to see - do you have 45 seconds?"
```

---

### 2. WIGGLE #1 (15 sec)
**Read CRM Field #2 verbatim**
```
Example: "Your site has 1,451 keyword rankings, 
but 86.2% are buried on page 2 or higher. 
Only 20 keywords are on page 1 where people actually click."
```

---

### 3. WIGGLE #2 (15 sec)
**Read CRM Field #3 verbatim**
```
Example: "You have 11 keywords sitting at positions 11-20, 
just barely off page 1, worth $1,429 per month if we push them up."
```

---

### 4. THE BITE (20-30 sec)
**Read CRM Fields #4-6 (Quick Wins) verbatim**
```
Example: "Let me give you three specific examples:

'Pool design' is at position 12 with an $8.51 cost-per-click - 
that's only 2 spots from page 1, worth $213 per month.

'Inground swimming pools' at #14, $5.39, worth $129 per month.

'Swimming pool contractors' at #15, $5.92, worth $133 per month.

These aren't junk keywords - these are money keywords."
```

---

### 5. SET THE HOOK (20 sec)
**Read CRM Field #8 (Your Strength) verbatim**
```
Example: "You've got 'pool builder' ranked #1 with a $7.20 cost-per-click. 
So you KNOW how to rank when you execute right."
```

---

### 6. REEL TO SHORE (30 sec)
**Read CRM Field #9 (Action Plan) verbatim**
```
Example: "Look, fixing those 10 'almost there' keywords equals 
$1,429 per month in additional traffic value, 60-90 day timeline, 
about 80 hours of work.

Can I show you exactly which keywords we'd target first 
and why they're the easiest wins?"
```

## 💰 PACKAGE QUICK GUIDE

| Prospect Says... | Use This Package |
|------------------|------------------|
| "I don't have much budget" | 10¢ Opportunity |
| "My traffic dropped" | 11¢ History |
| "Show me everything" | 12¢ Combo ⭐ |
| "Who are my competitors?" | 15¢ Competitor |

**⭐ = Most Versatile (Start Here)**

---

## 🎯 GOLDEN RULES

### ✅ DO:
1. **Read numbers EXACTLY** - "$1,429" not "about $1,400"
2. **Quote actual keywords** - "pool design" not "some keywords"
3. **Use their #1 ranking** - Proves they CAN rank
4. **Show spots to page 1** - "Only 2 spots away"
5. **End with dollar value** - "$1,429/mo in 60-90 days"

### ❌ DON'T:
1. **Round numbers** - Precision = credibility
2. **Speak generally** - Be specific always
3. **Skip their strength** - Always show they can win
4. **Forget timeline** - "60-90 days" creates urgency
5. **Leave them hanging** - Ask for meeting/audit

## 📊 OBJECTION HANDLERS

### "I already do SEO"
**Response:** Read Field #9 (Recent Drop)
> "I understand, but I noticed in the last 30 days, your 'pool installation cost' 
> keyword dropped from #8 to #13. That's an $8.45 keyword, you just lost 
> $2,113 per month. Something's not working. Can I show you what happened?"

### "Send me information"
**Response:** Use urgency from Field #10 (Fell Off)
> "I can do that, but I want to flag this now - 10 of your keywords 
> fell off page 1, worth $847 per month. While you review information, 
> your competitors are taking those spots. Can we do a quick 10-minute 
> call so you see exactly what's at stake?"

### "I need to think about it"
**Response:** Reference competitor (Field #2 if using 15¢ package)
> "I totally understand. Just FYI - I also pulled [competitor name]. 
> They're 3.4X bigger than you and winning 72% of direct keyword battles. 
> While you're thinking, they're growing. Want to see the head-to-head comparison?"

### "How much does it cost?"
**Response:** Flip to value (Field #9)
> "Our packages range from $2,000-5,000/month depending on scope. 
> But I just showed you $1,429 per month in quick wins from 10 keywords. 
> That's your investment back in 60-90 days, then pure profit after that. 
> Makes sense to at least see the full audit, right?"

### "I'm busy right now"
**Response:** Quick summary
> "I get it. Super quick - you have $1,429 per month sitting 2-10 spots 
> away from page 1. I can send you the keyword list. Takes 2 minutes to 
> review. What's a better time - later today or tomorrow morning?"

Say actual keyword names they can verify:
> "Your 'pool design' keyword is at #12..."

If you have competitor data (15¢ package), USE IT:

### Tip #6: Quick Wins = Low Risk
Emphasize "almost there" keywords:
> "These are only 2-5 spots away, not 50 spots"

### Tip #7: Timeline Matters
Never say "we can help." Say:
> "60-90 days, about 80 hours of work"

### Tip #8: End with Question
Always close with a question:
> "Want to see the full keyword list?"
> "Can I show you the audit?"
> "Makes sense to look at it, right?"

## 📞 SAMPLE CALL (12¢ Package - poolsbybradley.com)

**AGENT:** Hi John, this is Mike from [Company]. I was pulling SEO data for pool companies in your area and your site came up. Found something you need to see - do you have 45 seconds?

**PROSPECT:** Yeah, what is it?

**AGENT:** Your site has 1,451 keyword rankings in Google, which is solid, but 86.2% are buried on page 2 or higher. Only 20 keywords are on page 1 where people actually click. That means 1,431 keywords are generating virtually zero traffic.

**PROSPECT:** Okay...

**AGENT:** But here's what got my attention - you have 11 keywords sitting at positions 11-20, just barely off page 1, worth $1,429 per month if we push them up.

**PROSPECT:** Like what?

**AGENT:** Let me give you three specific examples. 'Pool design' is at position 12 with an $8.51 cost-per-click - that's only 2 spots from page 1, worth $213 per month. 'Inground swimming pools' at #14, $5.39, worth $129 per month. 'Swimming pool contractors' at #15, $5.92, worth $133 per month. These aren't junk keywords - these are money keywords.

**PROSPECT:** Interesting. How do you know we can rank for these?

**AGENT:** Because you've already got 'pool builder' ranked #1 with a $7.20 cost-per-click. You're getting 720 searches per month on that. So you KNOW how to rank when you execute right.

**PROSPECT:** Fair point.

**AGENT:** Look, fixing those 10 'almost there' keywords equals $1,429 per month in additional traffic value, 60-90 day timeline, about 80 hours of work. Can I show you exactly which keywords we'd target first and why they're the easiest wins?

**PROSPECT:** Yeah, send me the list.

**AGENT:** I can do that, but I also noticed something time-sensitive. In the last 30 days, your 'pool installation cost' keyword dropped from #8 to #13. That's an $8.45 keyword - you just lost $2,113 per month on that drop alone. While I send the list, can we schedule a quick 15-minute call tomorrow so I can walk you through what happened and how to fix it?

**PROSPECT:** Sure, tomorrow at 2pm works.

**AGENT:** Perfect. I'll send the keyword list now, and I'll have the full competitive analysis ready for our call tomorrow. You're going to want to see how you stack up against [competitor]. Talk to you at 2!
