```
COMPETITOR INTELLIGENCE - Major missing section!

Available SpyFu Endpoints I Didn't Test:
1. getDomainCompetitors - Get top competing domains
2. getSharedRankingKeywords - Keywords you both rank for
3. getCompetitorBuyingKeywords - Keywords they advertise on

This is EXACTLY what cold callers need:

you on 34 of those. Want to know which ones?"

of this spend. Let me show you which keywords..."

Available SpyFu Endpoints:

## üÜï NEW DATA POINTS I DISCOVERED (Not in Your Tool)

### 1. **Ranking Movement & Velocity**

```javascript
// You have: Static rank position
// I added: Historical changes with urgency

fields.Dramatic_Drop = "Pool Builders Near Me | #20‚Üí#56 | -26 clicks"
fields.Rising_Stars = "Minto Builders | #43‚Üí#34 (+9)"
fields.Momentum_Score = "+15 improved | -8 declined | Score: +7"
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Creates **urgency** in cold calls
- Shows **recent losses** (pain point)
- Highlights **positive momentum** (ride the wave)

### 2. **"Almost There" Rankings (#11-16)**

```javascript
// You show: Keywords on page 1
// I added: Keywords ALMOST on page 1

fields.Almost_There = "8 KWs positions #11-16 (one push from page 1)"
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Shows **low-hanging fruit**
- Easier to pitch than "#87 to #1"
- Quick wins = credibility

### 3. **Click Value Calculations**

```javascript
// You show: Traffic numbers
// I added: Dollar value conversions

fields.Money_Potential = "$3.94 √ó 450 clicks = $1,773/mo potential"
```

**Why This Matters:**
- **Speaks money**, not metrics
- Easy for business owners to understand
- Shows **ROI opportunity** immediately

### 4. **Fell Off Page 1 (Urgent Pain Point)**

```javascript
// You show: Current rankings
// I added: What they LOST recently

fields.Fell_Off_Page1 = "3 keywords | -45 clicks/mo | $118 lost value"
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Creates **immediate urgency**
- They know something broke
- You're the solution

### 5. **New Rankings (Last 30 Days)**

```javascript
// You show: All current keywords
// I added: NEWLY ranked keywords

fields.New_Rankings = "5 new KWs | Pool Designers #43 (fresh opportunity)"
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Shows **momentum already started**
- Capitalize before competitors notice
- Easier pitch than "start from scratch"

## üöÄ UPDATED COLD CALL SCRIPT (Using Combined Data)

### Opening (10 seconds):
> "Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. I pulled up poolsbybradley.com and noticed something urgent - you've got a major ranking drop happening. Got 60 seconds?"

### Hook - URGENCY (20 seconds):
> "Your main keyword 'Pool Builders Near Me' fell from #20 to #56 in the last 30 days. That's costing you 26 clicks per month - about $110 in lost traffic. Plus you fell off page 1 for 3 other keywords. Something changed with Google's algorithm."

### Hook - COMPETITOR (20 seconds):
> "Meanwhile, your main competitor poolsbybradley.com shares 59 keywords with you, and they're beating you on 34 of them. They're also spending $1,457/month on Google Ads while you're doing SEO. They know something."

### Value Prop - OPPORTUNITY (30 seconds):
> "Here's the good news: You have 23 keywords sitting in positions #4-#10 on page 1. These are LOW-HANGING FRUIT. You also have 8 keywords at #11-#16 - one small push and they're on page 1. And you just started ranking for 5 new keywords last month - fresh momentum we can accelerate. With minor optimization, we could double your 498 monthly clicks in 90 days."

### Value Prop - MONEY (20 seconds):
> "You're currently getting $3,264/month in free organic traffic. But you're leaving money on the table - if we pushed your best keywords to top 3, you'd be looking at $6,500+/month. That's $40K+ annual value, and we can get there for $2,000/month."

### Close - TECH STACK (15 seconds):
> "I see you're on WordPress with CloudFlare - perfect setup for what we do. You've had the domain for 11 years, so Google trusts you. We just need to capitalize on that authority. Can I show you the exact keywords we'd target?"
